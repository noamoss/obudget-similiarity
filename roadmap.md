# Road map for continuation:
# --------------------------
#
# 1. Turn "id column" into a source file property
# 2. Finish implementation of direct comparison for all datapackages
# 3. Apply indirect comparison (based on another entity)
# 4. Split list fields (i.e. names, areas etc.) into separate features
# 5. Improve tokenization: a. initial+word+finals   b. male/female
# 6. Move dataloader to local storage
