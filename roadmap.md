# Road map (plans):

1. Finish implementation of direct comparison for all datapackages:

2. Apply indirect comparison (based on another entity)

3. Split list fields (i.e. names, areas etc.) into separate features (will enable to apply "budget": http://next.obudget.org/datapackages/budgetkey/budget/)

4. Improve tokenization: a. initial+word+finals   b. male/female

5. Refactor and Move dataloader integration for local storage (instead of loading datapackage each time)

6. Automatic tests. A lots of them.
